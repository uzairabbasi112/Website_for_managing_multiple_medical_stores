# Database Project of medical Store website
Here is a website for handling and managing multiple stores (in my case 4 stores) that are handled by one admin and each store is handled by manager wo insert, update, delete the detial of medicine, their stocks and sales data. This data will be checked by admin and is shown to him in a proper GUI.

In order to run this website, firstly you have to install xampp server and in the xampp control you have to start apache server and mysql.
